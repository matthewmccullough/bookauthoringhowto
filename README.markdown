This is a repository of ideas, techniques, tools and tricks on how to write a technical book.

It seems odd at first to make this a repo, but I expect tools and other things to drop into it over time.

This was started by the effort of Neal Ford, Nate Schutta and I writing www.presentationpatterns.com and then Dan Allen collaborating on the contents with his findings.

Pull requests are very welcome.
